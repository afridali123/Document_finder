# Document_finder
As we deal with hundreds of documents daily, we occasionally do forget about some of them down the line. What if we want a particular old presentation again for our work, where we unfortunately do not remember the name or content of that document to retrieve it from the large storage on our computer or cloud. That's where a document finder comes to our rescue, which can search for the document of our need based on a query input. This will not only help in faster access to the document but will also help in grouping similar documents together and in analysing them.
